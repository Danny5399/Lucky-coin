Exchange Platform
LUCKYINVEST (LUC) we are a decentralized exchange platform for exchanging BEP-20 tokens on the most stable Binance Smart Chain network. This network guarantees superior speed and lower transaction costs on the network. Decentralized financing through products and services is fast, secure, and tokens can be swapped by anyone. and can connect to multiple wallets

Exchange
Users can swap their tokens through the swap already created some mainstream trading pair liquidity pools. Users can swap between any two supported tokens by paying a 0.2% swap fee. LUC swap Exchange is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows a user to exchange two tokens on the Binance Smart Chain network. The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their tokens in Liquidity Pools. In exchange, a user gets LP tokens that can also be staked to earn LUC tokens in the "Farms".
Liquidity
Liquidity pool is used to facilitate swapping, loaning, perpetual contract, and options functions in LUC swap. We create LUC to USDT, BNB, and other mainstream trading pair liquidity pools in future

When you add liquidity to the pool, you will get LP tokens. When someone makes a token swap, a transaction fee of 0.2% . The liquidity pool will also allow you to stake your LP tokens to earn LUC tokens in the ‚ÄúFarms‚Äù. Hence, apart from earning income from token swap transactions, a user will be able to stake LP tokens and earn LUC tokens.
Farms
LUC offer multiple farming opportunities to our users. You can stake your LP and earn LUC Coin in return. We will incentivize many liquidity pairs by offering our Liquidity Providers the chance to stake their LP in our farms.
Yield farming can give better rewards than Syrup Pools, but it comes with a risk of Impermanent Loss. It‚Äôs not as scary as it sounds, but it is worth learning about the concept before you get started.
Lottery
The LUC Lottery is a game of chance in which winners are selected randomly. Our lottery allows every user who bought at least one lottery ticket.
 
          Specifics
          Valid lottery token: LUC
          Lottery ticket cost: $1 in LUC

          Max number of tickets to be purchased at a time: unlimited
          Duration: 12 hours for 1 lottery round
          One lottery ticket gives a user a random 6-digit combination with each digit being 
          between   0-9.
 
          Ticket costs and bulk purchase discount
          Lottery ticket prices are set at the start of the new lottery round, and target $1 USD.
          Buying multiple Lottery tickets at once gives a bulk discount on your purchase.
Launch Pools

beginning, a user could stake only LUC tokens in exchange for more LUC. Now, there are more opportunities, Future Swap can stake LUC in exchange for other coin, too.

What Is BEP-20
BEP-20 is a Binance Smart Chain token standard created with the intention of extending ERC-20, which is one of the most common Ethereum token standards out there. BEP-20 is a blueprint as to how a token can be spent, who can spend it, and it even has rules about its overall usage. The BEP-20 standard was both derived from and fully compatible with the ERC-20 standard, and the code of the functions that define the BEP-20 standard are modifications of the ERC-20 standard. These modifications were done and intended to improve the protocol while also optimizing its speed as well as transaction cost. In fact, BEP-20 was conceived as this technical specification for the Binance Smart chain with the goal of actually providing a flexible format through which many developers can launch different tokens. These tokens could represent anything from shares within a business to dollars, which are stored in a bank vault such as stablecoins.üí•Token allocation

What are allocations and vesting in tokenomics
Token allocation is the percentage of tokens that are distributed among different stakeholder groups within a crypto project. The allocation of tokens among different parties in a project, including the founders, and the community, can provide insights into the project's long-term strategy and stability. The founders or team typically receive tokens based on their dedication and contribution to building the product, reflecting their commitment to the project's success. project who take significant financial risks during the early stages of a project, often receive tokens at a lower cost through private funding rounds. When the lock-up period ends, project can influence the market price due to their larger token allocation and lower acquisition cost. The community, consisting of end-users or supporters, may receive tokens as incentives for their involvement. This can demonstrate the project's commitment to user engagement.üí∞How to buy token
